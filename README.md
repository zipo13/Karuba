# Karuba
This is a helper app for the [Karuba](https://www.habausa.com/karuba-tile-laying-puzzle-game/) board game.

It was made as part of my Android development learning path and demonstrates the basic use of Animation in Andrid apps.

You can use the code freely to learn how to animate your own app and download the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=il.co.woo.karuba&hl=en)
